# Forge — Cursor Plugin

Work order management, developer activity tracking, and project context for AI-assisted development workflows in [Forge](https://app.softwareforge.ai).

## Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Work Orders** | Manage tasks through their full lifecycle — pick, implement, commit, PR, complete |
| **Dev Activity** | Sync commits and PRs from linked repos, validate consistency, replay gaps |
| **Project Context** | Set active project, list repos, search artifacts, access requirements |
| **Pre-commit Guard** | Enforces Forge pre-commit checklist for `[WO-]` / `[TASK-]` commits (tests, acceptance criteria, activity report) |
| **Dangerous Ops Guard** | Blocks force-pushes, destructive commands, and unreviewed prod deployments |
| **Session Tracking** | Reminds to sync activity when agent session ends |

## Install

### Team Marketplace (enterprise)

Import this repository in Cursor **Team Marketplace** (see [docs/team-marketplace-setup.md](docs/team-marketplace-setup.md)).

Repository: [securefactory/forge-cursor-plugin](https://github.com/securefactory/forge-cursor-plugin)

### Public marketplace (after approval)

Submit or install from the [Cursor Marketplace](https://cursor.com/marketplace) once listed. Plugin ID: **`forge`**, display name: **Forge**.

Until listed, use Team Marketplace import or [local install](#local-development) below.

### Pre-submit / pre-release checklist

```bash
node scripts/validate-plugin.mjs
```

Then verify MCP: Forge **Install in IDE → Cursor**, confirm a Forge server is green under **Settings → Tools & MCP** (usually **`user-forge`**), run **`/forge-status`** in **Agent** chat.

**Slash commands not showing?** Plugin must be **enabled** in Customize → Plugins, and commands only appear in **Agent** chat (`/forge-connect`, `/forge-status`, …). If the plugin page lists commands but `/` does not, the local plugin cache is likely empty (common with private repos) — see [docs/team-marketplace-setup.md](docs/team-marketplace-setup.md#slash-commands-not-loading).

## Connect MCP (required)

Forge MCP is **separate from this plugin**. The plugin ships workflow (hooks, skills, commands) only — each developer connects MCP once via user or project Cursor config.

### Preferred — one-click install from Forge UI

Forge generates a personal `forge_...` token and writes to **`~/.cursor/mcp.json`** (user/global scope).

1. Log into [Forge](https://app.softwareforge.ai)
2. Use any of these entry points:
   - **Application Context** → open a project → **Connect IDE** tab → **Install in IDE** → **Cursor**
   - **Project Settings** → **Connect IDE** section → **Install in IDE** → **Cursor**
   - **User Settings** (avatar menu) → **API Tokens** → **Install in IDE** → **Cursor**
3. Accept the MCP install prompt in Cursor when it opens.
4. Confirm under **Settings → Tools & MCP** that a Forge server is connected (green) — typically **`user-forge`**.

On the **Connect IDE** tab you can also **Create an API Token**, then click **Install in Cursor** under **One-Click Install**.

**Note:** **Open in IDE** on a work order card launches that task in your editor — it is not the MCP install flow.

### Alternative — manual user/global `~/.cursor/mcp.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "forge": {
      "type": "streamable-http",
      "url": "https://app.softwareforge.ai/api/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer forge_..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Create a token under **Connect IDE** → **Create an API Token**, or in **User Settings** → **API Tokens**.

### Alternative — project `.cursor/mcp.json`

Same JSON shape in **`.cursor/mcp.json`** at the repo root for team-scoped MCP (merged with user config). `/forge-status` and `/forge-connect` check **both** files.

Run **`/forge-connect`** for step-by-step MCP install guidance. Use **`/forge-status`** to discover the active server and diagnose connection issues.

## First session

After MCP is connected, call `configure_repo` once per session:

```json
{ "ide": "cursor", "hooks_already_present": true }
```

This registers the session with Forge and unlocks work order tools.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/forge-connect` | **Start here** — MCP install, verify connection, configure session, select project |
| `/forge-status` | **Validate MCP** — readiness report; install steps if disconnected |
| `/forge-context` | Load journey state, linked repos, and key artifacts (intent, PRD, architecture, RTM) |
| `/forge-artifacts` | Fetch one artifact by type or `search_artifacts` by keyword |
| `/forge-orders` | Browse work orders — stats, filters, details, comments, clarifications |
| `/forge-sync` | Sync commits/PRs to Forge (`sync_dev_activity`); validate or replay if needed |
| `/work` | Pick or show the next work order |
| `/start-work` | Full workflow: context → implement → commit → PR → complete |

## MCP tools reference

All tools live on your **connected Forge MCP server** (discovered via `/forge-status` — typically **`user-forge`** or **`forge`**, tools as `mcp__<server>__<tool>`). Skills document workflows and parameters in detail.

| `get_project_state` | Journey step, ref code, metadata |
| `configure_repo` | Session hooks gate (required before work order tools) |
| `get_artifact` | Latest artifact: `intent`, `prd`, `brd`, `architecture`, `work_orders`, `rtm` |

MCP is **not** bundled — developers connect via **`~/.cursor/mcp.json`** (user/global) and/or **`.cursor/mcp.json`** (project).

## Local Development

1. Clone and open this repo in Cursor
2. Connect MCP via Forge **Install in IDE → Cursor** (user `~/.cursor/mcp.json`) or add `.cursor/mcp.json` / manual config
3. Run `node scripts/validate-plugin.mjs`
4. Optional: copy the plugin bundle to `~/.cursor/plugins/local/forge` and **Developer: Reload Window**
5. Run `/forge-status` then `/forge-connect`

To test plugin hooks in isolation, copy to the local plugins folder:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cursor/plugins/local/forge
cp -R forge ~/.cursor/plugins/local/forge
# Developer: Reload Window
```

Cleanup:

```bash
rm -rf ~/.cursor/plugins/local/forge
# Or Uninstall from Settings → Plugins → Forge Local
```

## Validation

```bash
node scripts/validate-plugin.mjs
```
